--------------------
NOTES

-> create table of users to display scoreboard on home page
	-> user ID
	-> user Name
	-> user Score

-> make some kind of scoring system... maybe 100 points for correct guess

-> make user input lowercase before submitting to server

-> get it to work with 1 v Everyone

-> make the page a little more "pretty" once all the kinks are worked out

-> save canvas as location to image to database... display saved on image on all screens. do this every second for minimal delay

-> randomly switch artist to one of the contestants after correct word is guessed, but wait a few seconds so the winner can bask in the glory
	
-> pass word and category with JSON instead of using a string

-> 'play again' button


IF TIME ALLOWS:
-------------------
-> pallette for different colors
